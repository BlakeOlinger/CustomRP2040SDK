	** Atomic Register Access **

 * normal read/write
Addr + 0x0000

 * atomic XOR on write
Addr + 0x1000

 * atomic bitmask set on write
Addr + 0x2000

 * atomic bitmask clear on write
Addr + 0x3000


	** List of Registers **
 * NOTE: all mnemonics are not mine but the official SDK

 * bus fabric registers start at a base address of:
0x40030000		BUSCTRL_BASE

 * BUS_PRIORITY -- set the priority of each master for bus arbitration (1 high, 0 low)
offset:
0x00

bits:
